## Memory

### RAM
    
    This is use as temporary data storage for a computer. It is divided up into segments:
        
        * The stack - This is used to store function calls as stack frames and also use to store variables
          and other data during runtime. It is dynamic.

        * The heap - This is used to store objects that are dynamically created by the program

        * Bss - This stores the staic variables and data types as well as global variables.

        * text - This stores the code

    The ram nowadays can store around 8GB to 64B in a home computer.
    RAM is also volatile so all the data is lost after turning it off.

### ROM
    
    This is this is used to store firmaware and the BIOS/UEFI. The bios and uefi are methods of booting into
    an operating system. ROM can come in different forms: strictly read only memory is hardwired in and cannot
    be changed; more recent ROM has become read-only in normal operation but can be program in some ways.

## CPU

    The cpu is used to is used to do calculations on a computer, the main the part that does this is the ALU
    (arithmitic logic unit). The way it does these calculation is through logic gates which are made up of
    transistors. The cpu also contains a cache that is sort temporary storage.

## Motherboard
    
    This is a larg circuit board that you place your components upon. It is used to allow communication between
    the componets using the bus. This also contains ports like usb and sata.

### Sata
    Sata is use to communicate between components using serial connections. 

## PSU
    
    The psu is the power supply unit and is used to supply and regulate power between components. It can come in
    different forms: a normal fixed power supply unit has all of the wires fixed in place and cannot be removed;
    semi-modular power supply has some cables that are fixed and some that can be removed and reattached and finally
    you have modular power supplies where all of the wires are detachable. 

## GPU

    This is used to do graphics processing in a computer. It is not a neccesary component as most cpu's contain
    integrated graphics meaing they can do some simplstic graphics with. These are used in: gamming pc's, machine learning
    and brute forcing because the GPU is good at doing repetative tasks very fast.

## Storage

### Hard drive
    
    The hard drive is used to store data and programs like the operating system. Hard drives use magnetic storage to stores
    things using a rapidly rotating disk. It is non-voaltile memorary. Hard drives can also fail without warinig
